The skyline  
Blue  
Lit up with lights

Sweet lime and orange  
Someday lavender  
You still remember the smell

The tree  
Autumn it was  
Leaves floating, flying around

My days  
Might have lost some color  
But they still aren't gray

Dim lights and dull sounds  
I still hear my heart beat  
From nothing to green leaves
