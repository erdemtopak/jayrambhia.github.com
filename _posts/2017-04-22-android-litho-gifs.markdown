title: Android GIF search engine with Litho
description: Build an android GIF search engine with Litho by engine and giphy
---

I recently tried my hands with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - A Javascript library for building user interfaces. I started following this amazing tutorial - 
[React 101](https://blog.tighten.co/react-101-building-a-gif-search-engine) by [Tighten](http://blog.tighten.co/). I had just finished building my first GIF search engine
and Facebook open sourced [Litho](http://fblitho.com/) - A declarative UI framework for Android. Well, Litho takes a lot of inspiration from React. I had just started to get my hands dirty with React (and liked it), I thought I give Litho a try. So what should I do? GIF search engine for Android using Litho!

# Litho
I am not going to talk about what Litho or React is. Well, as the website says Litho is a declerative UI framework for Android. It uses [Yoga](https://facebook.github.io/yoga/) - cross-platform layout engine which uses Flexbox like styling. If you are not from a web development background, a lot of things are going to sound strage and yes, I also find it strage but then again I try to learn other things to know what good stuff they have. Flexbox is good and so seems Yoga. Before, proceeding further, I would suggest that you go through [Getting Started](http://fblitho.com/docs/getting-started) and [Tutorial](http://fblitho.com/docs/tutorial) of Litho.

Since Litho seems to be inspired from React, it uses `Components` and you can make a great UI with adding bunch of components and those components are reusable! Facebook has spent a lot of time and resources in making Litho efficient. It wants to be so efficient that it generates most of its own code. As a end user, you can not create a Component (You can but it would not be efficent). You write a `ComponentSpec` and Litho will generate all the code for you. Have you used Dagger 2? Yes, it's that amount of generated code so I guess method count is going to go sky high! There are two types of CompoentSpec.

 1. LayoutSpec
 2. MountSpec

MountSpec is if you want to customize a lot of things. We'll talk about it later. LayoutSpec - quoting from the docs,

> A layout spec is the logical equivalent of a composite view on Android. It simply groups existing components together in an immutable layout tree.

Less talk, more code!

Let's just dive into it.

# GIF search engine App
It's just a simple one screen - no navigation (yet) app to search GIFs from [Giphy](http://giphy.com/). It's a glorified search engine. I have used Retrofit to fetch data and Glide to load gifs, but I won't be discussing it in this post.

Since it's a simple app, all we need is an `EditText` and a `RecyclerView`. Conventionally, we would use a `LinearLayout` with vertical orientation and add an EditText and a RecyclerView in XML. But we're going to talk Litho and bit of React. In Recat, these things are considered components. So Let's start there.

## Components
As you can easily figure out, we would need one component to hold EditText and RecyclerView. Let's call it `HomeComponent`.

### HomeComponent
To generate HomeComponent, we require a HomeComponent Spec which would look something like this.

{% gist jayrambhia/cd0e65e1b24f45d2bb05a790e812468a HomeComponentSpec.java %}

Litho will generate HomeComponent class which you can use. If you notice, we are using `@Prop String hint`. **`@Prop`** comes from React where you can pass some properties to components. We do not require this property, but we are going to use it anyway. We take this property and set it as EditText's hint. We need to stack the views horizontally, so we'll use `Column` as it stacks the views horizontally. We can add views with `child` method.

Note: EditText is a litho's widget. It is **to be confused** with Android's EditText because litho's EditText renders Android's EditText.

To display HomeComponent on the screen, we will modify `MainActivity`.

{% gist jayrambhia/cd0e65e1b24f45d2bb05a790e812468a MainActivity.java %}

If you run the app now, you'll just see an EditText at the top. We have not added any data/views to the RecyclerView component. So Let's add some data.

### GifItemViewComponent
As we discussed, all the views are components. Each item in the RecyclerView will also be a component. We need to make a component for that.
Since we are going to show a gif, let's name it GifItemViewComponent. We will need to write a Component Spec. Here, we are just going to show a simple title.

{% gist jayrambhia/cd0e65e1b24f45d2bb05a790e812468a GifItemViewSpec.java %}

Now, we need to add some dummy data so that we can see something on the screen. We need to update `HomeComponentSpec.getRecyclerComponent`.

{% gist jayrambhia/cd0e65e1b24f45d2bb05a790e812468a HomeComponentSpec-Recycler.java %}

`RecyclerBinder` is sort of a super RecyclerView Adapter which takes care of creating views. It's supposed to be highly optimised. RecyclerView Adapter recycles ViewHolders but RecyclerBinder recycles each view. It will recycle and use `Text`, `Image`, etc even for different components in the RecyclerView.

`binder.insertItemAt(position, ComponentInfo)` is used to add Component at a specified position.

Now, you'll see a list of huge "Hello World" on your screen. Let's try to change that and get more dynamic content. We can do this by sending title as a prop.

{% gist jayrambhia/cd0e65e1b24f45d2bb05a790e812468a GifItemViewSpec-1.java %}

We also need to update our binder insert method, otherwise we'll get a runtime exception as we did not pass `@Prop String title` to GifItemView.

{% gist jayrambhia/cd0e65e1b24f45d2bb05a790e812468a HomeComponentSpec-Recycler-1.java %}

Now, we have different data on the screen. But, how would we update it in case we get some different data? 

### States
Litho has something called `@State` where you can define and update the states of the component. But it's not so easy. There is some pre-defined APIs that are available and in `protected` scope so can't be called from outside. (eg. Activity). You could add a static methodin your Spec class which would trigger state update but it requires a `ComponentContext` and you could pass it from activitybut it would not work because it doesn't have any component bound to it. There aren't many (or any) example
which would show how to update recyclerview's (adapter) data dynamically.

After a lot of trial and erros, I figured out a better way to do it. Since we use `RecyclerBinder` to add/remove components, we just need access to that. So I decided to pass binder as a prop.

{% gist jayrambhia/cd0e65e1b24f45d2bb05a790e812468a HomeComponentSpec-1.java %}

We'll update MainActivity to load data after 2 seconds.

{% gist jayrambhia/cd0e65e1b24f45d2bb05a790e812468a MainActivity-1.java %}

If we can do this, it means that we can update the data from an API response.
