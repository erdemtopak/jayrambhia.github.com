title: Capture images using V4L2 on Linux
---

I have always been using OpenCV's `VideoCapture` API to capture images from webcam or USB cameras. OpenCV supports `V4L2` and I wanted to use something other than OpenCV's VideoCapture API so I started digging up about v4l2 and got few links using and few examples using which I successfully wrote a small code to grab an image using **V4L2** and convert it to OpenCV's Mat structure and display the image.

### What is V4L2?
V4L2 is the second version of Video For Linux which is a video capturing API for Linux. [Here](http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/) you can find amazing documentation about the API.
