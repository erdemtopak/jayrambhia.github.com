This wait seems so long  
I stand here all alone  
This stay feels so dead  
As the sun falls into the sea  
Dreams take over me  
This sleep is never ending  
Nightmares are far from here  
Still why doesn't anything look so clear  
Ice like blue, I watch the sky  
A voice calls out for me  
I turn around  
There i find the missing piece  
The smile on your face  
Completes my day and fits perfectly  
This is no dream  
I am in the real world  
With you by my side  
I watch the sun fall into the sea
