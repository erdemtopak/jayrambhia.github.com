Under a starry sky  
The moon passes by  
There i lie watching the sky  
Thinking about the days that went by  
Don't know if they were a dream  
But still can't tell if they were real  
I am still sure of meeting you again  
Because even if we go on different roads  
I know I will meet you again  
Because there are no two roads that don't meet again  
And then coming to a full circle  
I will say that I missed you  
We will lead a new life together  
And kiss you and say I will never leave you again
