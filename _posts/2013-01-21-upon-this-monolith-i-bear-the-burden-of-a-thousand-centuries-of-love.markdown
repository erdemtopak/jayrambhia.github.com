I speak to you as if you hear  
But this sullen silence doesn't fade  
These constellations don't define me  
But when did the sky start to care

Give solace, oh traitor  
Overthrow and dictate  
Read all my names and you will find yours  
Find me my love and I will leave alone

Bring me the sky and I will put you up  
Stars give light but I'll give you the sun  
Watch over me my love  
Because I'm about to fall

A sepulcher awaits my name  
And when I leave this place  
Then you will cry beside my grave
