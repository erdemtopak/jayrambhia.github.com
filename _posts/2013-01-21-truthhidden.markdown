Let's Begin

Make a Start  
Find What's Wrong

I am Here, there you go  
Leaving me here, What's Left to do?  
Come back, start something else, not wars!

[Chorus]
I have been waiting for something new  
I have been waiting for someone to find me  
I can't find you there  
I can't see you there  
Standing all alone

I can't just wait  
I can't hold on x2


Let's just go back to where we began  
Let's just go back and find where it started

[Chorus]

It's Killing Me  
Crushing  
things go blank  
Disasters  
Stay Back

(Start)
Truth marks the start of a war that never began  
Leaves fall down, the wind blows

What have you been waiting for?  
Just someone to explain-  
Why all this pain?

PAIN  
WAR  
SUFFERINGS
