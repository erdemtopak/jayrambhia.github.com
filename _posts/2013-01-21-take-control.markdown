Watch me drown  
Sink into the nothingness  
Everything is not lost  
Hope lives forever  
Never give up  
Don't look back  
Don't stare!

Find what's lost  
All hope is not gone  
Take yourself  
Smoke rises up in the air  
Bridges burn  
Bodies collapse  
Godspeed to you

The fall arrives  
Cross them all  
Break everything  
Try Hard  
Don't leave a chance  
For those cowards  
to WIN!

Ride across these barren lands  
Fight the battle  
Which has not ended since eternity  
The battle in your mind  
Evoking you to lie to yourself!

Don't give up now  
The war is nearly won  
Blood flows like a river  
Just like words flow as a stream

TAKE CONTROL
