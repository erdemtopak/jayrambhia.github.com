High above the sky  
Over the clouds and the moon  
Pure and white as snow  
Engulfed in beautiful solitude

Where i lie seeing the sun go  
Into the horizon  
Like a Sunday afternoon  
Lost in the northern lights  

None of us will know  
Of how you and me came  
Together for sometime

Be it your amazing grace or  
Eternal beauty and glory

Holding the sword by the hilt  
En route to get it done  
Releasing the sands of time  
Ending the pandemonium forever
