The train passes the last stop  
Watching the mountains pass by  
I am just another man  
Trying to die for something right

See the light at the tunnel's end  
Beyond that lies a barren land  
Hear the blasts, hear the fire  
Don't lose faith in yourself

You know it in your heart  
You know, you're right  
Feel that life in yourself  
Behind you, lay another fallen life

Now you have another reason to live for  
Do not die on him  
Or on that girl at home  
Life runs on hope

Hope is what i have  
I have faith in you  
But you need to stay strong  
And when you return, there won't be a flag over your body

I know this  
And i know this for sure  
Your return would be  
The time the darkness died
