The wind never dies  
These thoughts never cease  
Shades of black describe everything  
I see people clad in white  
Is this another aimless journey called life?

Walk with me  
Let me take you by your hand  
Stop living with yourself  
Your life is worth living  
Don't let it waste by

These thoughts will scar your memory  
I am not just another somebody  
Do i mean anything to you?  
Even if you won't say it  
But i still know

In the wake of determination  
I take an oath  
That I'll keep you safe  
No matter what storms may come  
And disasters dawn  
I will not let you feel alone  
As long as I'm there with you
