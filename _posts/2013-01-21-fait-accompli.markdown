Behind this golden gate  
Winter calls out for me  
Find something and keep it safe  
Treasure hunters live a hard death  
Sing to me  
Breathe you melody into my heart  
Go condemn the immortal  
Travel a thousand miles  
Fight many battles  
Die a hundred deaths  
My bullet waits at your door  
I am your fall  
Violence disguised in blood  
I am your savior  
I am your life  
Sacrifice is fait accompli
