Take my hand  
Hold me tight  
I will take you out of this prison

These questions are meaningless  
You know the answers yourself  
The key to your freedom, lies inside you

Does it take strength to stand up?  
Do these thoughts eat you up?  
What do you think, you have become?

Well a puppet is what, resembles you  
Your master, lies to you  
So, cut these strings, And  
Runaway from this hell of yours  

I am not your savior  
I am just a man  
Leading you to the path, out of this cage
