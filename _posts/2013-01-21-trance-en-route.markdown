Hear the silence  
Hear the sound  
Hear the screams  
Calling you out to me

Those eyes watch you from the sky  
Still why doesn't anyone come to help you  
You are on your one  
Don't call for help

This red sky is just nothing  
This is not the end  
Fight your way through the darkness  
I will be there waiting for you

Hold my hand  
Take me by the arm  
We both don't know everything  
Let's put this epic down into the books

Do you dream or just make false promises to yourself?  
Everywhere I see, I see nothing but disasters  
I need someone to help me  
Stay by my side, don't let me fall down
