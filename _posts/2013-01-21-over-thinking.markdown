I just need you by my side  
You will always be locked inside my heart  
I am incomplete without your smile  
Don't cry just smile for this time  
The cheer on your face makes my day  
I hope i can be with you again  
Just one day or maybe just for a while  
I have learnt many things in all this time  
Crying won't help neither you nor me  
And what we have done won't help anyone  
These days would come again  
But not the time we spent with each other till date  
Don't cry when you read this  
Because I already am and I'm not fine
