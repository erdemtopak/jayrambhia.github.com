So, my GSoC 2012 package arrived today. Got a pen, diary (tablet as they say), Google prepaid card (with $505 balance.. woohoo) and a cool GSoC sticker.[![](http://www.jayrambhia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/package.jpg)](http://www.jayrambhia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/package.jpg)

I was hoping to get a GSoC t-shirt. Anyway, the package has arrived, I have got my work scheduled for the first week. It officially begins.

P.S. I got a haircut. One Simply can't get a good haircut.
