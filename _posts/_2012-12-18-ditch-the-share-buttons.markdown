<p class="lead">We all love the Internet and not one moment passes when we do not open Twitter, or check Facebook, or see what is happening on our other social feeds. And then there are these important bits like news, videos, music and similar other things.</p>

We are living in an age where using social media is a necessity. Not only do we need these channels for interacting with our audiences, but for a majority of us, news comes via these channels.

## So, what do we lose out on?
The repercussions of using social media buttons and utilities are not many as compared to the advantages but the problems are good enough to be listed out.

* Load time

The modern day browsers have done a great job with rendering fonts and styles. Forget that, they can even render games for us. But, they lack one important feature that can change our lives. Imagine, you browser allowing you to use in-built codes for social media services which you can just stitch with your application's fabric and get done with all those heavy features.

Let's take a simple example of the Facebook like button. It fetches the js and then you get to see the button for the first time. Till then, your page is still loading and you do not have an idea of what is going to appear. The problem- it leaves the user, **clueless**. Instead, if your browser could have shown the button and then asynchronously got the data from Facebook, wouldn't it be just great?

The other most popular button which does the job much better than Facebook and that is Twitter. Even twitter loads a js, but it comes with 'not strings attached'. Twitter is simple as always in this approach. Just one button that will say Tweet/Follow and it's done. Even those twitter embeds are not much of a headache.
