<div class="g three-quarters portable-one-whole" markdown="1">
I am Jay Rambhia. I'm interested in solving real world problems using Computer Vision. I want to track every object which has the rarest possibility of being tracked. Yeah, I'm paranoid.

I love to code. I write various applicaitons using Python and C++, especially Computer Vision based applications. I have participated in Google Summer of Code 2012 with SimpleCV. I believe in open source and I'm an active developer of [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/). You can fork my work on [Github](https://github.com/jayrambhia).

I love to teach. I have been taking workshops on Basics of Python in my college. I also teach Introduction to Computer Vision under [CTE](https://sites.google.com/site/bitscte/) along with [Ameya](http://ameyajoshi005.wordpress.com/) and [Siddharth](http://algorithmicthoughts.wordpress.com).

Along with all this, I also have a nag for design. I had been selected for MIT Media Labs - Design Innovation workshop where I proptotyped a haptic pen for blind people with Aditi and Nikita. Read more about it [here](/blog/freehand).
