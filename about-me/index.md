## Hey!

I am an undergraduate student who lives on computer vision based applications for real world. I like to implement theories to solve real world problems. I work with Python, C++ and Android to bring it all togehter.

## What do I like to do?

I love to code. I write various applications using Python and C++, especially Computer Vision based applications. I have participated in Google Summer of Code 2012 and 2013 with SimpleCV. I'm an active developer of [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/). I like to bring projects into reality and make it user friendly. Recently, I have been working with Android to put Computer Vision applications on mobile devices. You can fork my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/jayrambhia). Apart from that, I love to play Ultimate frisbee.
